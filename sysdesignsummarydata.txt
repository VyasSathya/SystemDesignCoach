# Comprehensive System Design Concepts

## Architectural Patterns and Components

1. **Load Balancing** - Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. Implements various algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connection, etc.) to determine which server receives each request. Crucial for high availability and scaling horizontally.
2. **Caching Strategies**:
    - **Write-through**: Data is written to both cache and database simultaneously. Ensures consistency but increases write latency.
    - **Write-around**: Data is written directly to database, bypassing cache. Cache is only updated when data is read. Good for data that's rarely accessed after writing.
    - **Write-back**: Data is initially written only to cache; it's written to database asynchronously later. Improves write performance but risks data loss if cache fails before data reaches database.
3. **Service Discovery** - Mechanism for services to find and communicate with each other in a dynamic environment without hardcoded locations. Uses a registry where services register themselves and lookup other services. Examples include Consul, Zookeeper, and Eureka.
4. **API Gateway** - Single entry point for all client requests to a system of microservices. Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, routing, protocol translation, and request aggregation. Simplifies client interactions with complex backend systems.
5. **Microservices Architecture** - Design approach where an application is built as a collection of small, autonomous services, each running in its own process and communicating via lightweight mechanisms. Each service focuses on a single business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Data Management

1. **Data Partitioning/Sharding**:
    - **Horizontal**: Splits rows of the same table across multiple databases/servers (e.g., users with IDs 1-1000 on server 1, 1001-2000 on server 2).
    - **Vertical**: Splits different columns/features into separate databases (e.g., user profiles on one server, user posts on another).
    - **Directory-based**: Uses a lookup service to track which data is on which server, adding flexibility but additional complexity.
2. **Consistent Hashing** - Algorithm for distributing data across multiple servers, ensuring minimal redistribution when servers are added or removed. Maps both servers and data to positions on a virtual ring, with data assigned to the next server clockwise on the ring. Solves the problem of having to remap all data when cluster size changes.
3. **Database Indexing** - Additional data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations at the cost of additional storage and slower writes. Like a book's index, it helps locate specific data without scanning the entire dataset. Critical for query performance in large databases.
4. **ACID vs. BASE**:
    - **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability): Guarantees reliable transaction processing, prioritizing consistency. Used in traditional relational databases.
    - **BASE** (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent): Relaxes consistency guarantees in favor of availability and partition tolerance. Common in NoSQL systems.
5. **Data Denormalization** - Intentionally adding redundant data to database tables to avoid costly joins and improve read performance. Instead of normalized tables requiring joins, data is duplicated to allow retrieval in a single query. Trades storage space and write complexity for read performance.

## Scaling Techniques

1. **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**:
    - **Horizontal**: Adding more machines to a system to handle increased load (scale out). More flexible, no downtime, but requires application support.
    - **Vertical**: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines (scale up). Simpler but has physical limits and often requires downtime.
2. **Read Replicas** - Copies of a database that only serve read operations, while writes go to a primary database that replicates changes to the copies. Allows distributing read traffic across multiple servers, significantly increasing read throughput.
3. **Connection Pooling** - Technique of maintaining a pool of reusable database connections, which can be borrowed and returned as needed. Eliminates the overhead of establishing new connections for each database operation, significantly improving performance.
4. **Back-of-the-envelope Calculations** - Quick, approximate calculations for system sizing and capacity planning. Uses rough estimates and simplified math to determine whether an approach is feasible (e.g., storage needed, requests per second, memory requirements).

## Resilience and Reliability

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevents system failure by detecting when a service is failing and stops sending requests to it for a predetermined time. Like an electrical circuit breaker, it "trips" to protect the system and periodically tests if the service has recovered.
2. **Redundancy** - Including duplicate components or functionality to eliminate single points of failure. If one component fails, a redundant component takes over, maintaining system functionality.
3. **Replication** - Creating and maintaining copies of data across multiple machines. Ensures data availability even if some machines fail and can also improve read performance by distributing queries across replicas.
4. **Graceful Degradation** - System design philosophy where functionality is reduced rather than failing completely when parts of the system are unavailable. For example, showing cached content when a database is down or disabling non-critical features during high load.
5. **Failover Mechanisms** - Automated processes that switch to a redundant system when a primary system fails. Can involve redirecting traffic, promoting a standby server to primary, or routing around failed components.

## Performance Optimization

1. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** - Distributed network of servers that delivers web content based on user's geographic location. Caches static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) at edge locations close to users, reducing latency and bandwidth costs.
2. **Message Queues** - Components that temporarily store messages between services for asynchronous processing. Allows services to communicate without being simultaneously available and helps manage traffic spikes by buffering requests.
3. **Database Connection Pooling** - Technique for managing a set of database connections that can be reused rather than creating a new connection for each request. Significantly reduces connection overhead and improves system performance.
4. **Request Collapsing** - Technique where multiple identical requests are combined into a single backend request. If multiple users request the same data simultaneously, only one database query is executed and the result is shared among all requesters.

## Real-time Systems

1. **Real-time Communication Protocols**:
    - **Long Polling**: Client requests information from server; if no data is available, server holds connection open until data arrives or timeout occurs.
    - **WebSockets**: Provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing real-time data exchange in both directions.
    - **Server-Sent Events**: Enables servers to push updates to browsers as one-way communication channel, ideal for real-time updates.
2. **Publisher-Subscriber Model** - Communication pattern where senders (publishers) don't send messages directly to receivers (subscribers). Instead, messages are categorized and subscribers receive only categories they're interested in, without knowledge of publishers.
3. **Push vs. Pull Models**:
    - **Push (fanout-on-write)**: Updates are immediately pushed to all relevant users/clients when data changes. Fast but can overwhelm systems with many recipients.
    - **Pull (fanout-on-load)**: Clients request updates periodically or on-demand. More scalable but may introduce latency.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

1. **Bloom Filters** - Space-efficient probabilistic data structure that tells you if an element is definitely not in a set or might be in a set. Used for quick membership checks before expensive operations, reducing unnecessary database lookups.
2. **QuadTrees** - Tree data structure where each node has exactly four children, used to partition two-dimensional space recursively. Efficient for spatial data like maps, allowing fast queries like "find all points within this area."
3. **Rate Limiting Algorithms**:
    - **Leaky Bucket**: Requests enter a fixed-size bucket; when the bucket is full, new requests are discarded. Requests leave at a constant rate.
    - **Token Bucket**: System adds tokens to a bucket at a steady rate; each request requires a token. When tokens are depleted, requests are denied until more tokens are added.
4. **Trie Data Structure** - Tree-like data structure optimized for prefix searches. Each node represents a character, and paths from root to nodes form words or prefixes. Efficient for implementing features like autocomplete, spell-check, or IP routing.

## Specialized System Designs

1. **Distributed File Systems** - Systems that manage storage and allow access to files from multiple hosts sharing a network. Files are split across multiple machines for scaling, while appearing as a single coherent file system. Examples include HDFS, GlusterFS.
2. **Distributed Search** - Search systems where both the index and query processing are spread across multiple machines. Enables searching massive datasets by partitioning the index and parallelizing the search process. Examples include Elasticsearch, Solr.
3. **Feed Generation Systems** - Systems that aggregate, rank, and deliver personalized content streams to users. Involves collecting inputs from many sources, filtering based on relevance, and generating personalized feeds efficiently. Used in social networks, news apps.
4. **Geospatial Indexing** - Specialized indexing techniques for location data that enable efficient queries like "find all restaurants within 5 miles." Uses structures like R-trees, quad trees, or geohashes to optimize spatial queries.

## Operational Concepts

1. **Health Checks** - Periodic tests performed on system components to determine if they're functioning correctly. Critical for load balancers to route traffic only to healthy servers and for early problem detection.
2. **Rate Limiting** - Controlling how many requests a user or service can make within a time period. Protects systems from abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and excessive resource consumption by limiting request frequency.
3. **Checkpointing** - Process of saving a system's state to persistent storage at consistent intervals. Allows recovery from a known good state after a failure without starting from scratch. Common in long-running processes.
4. **Exponential Backoff** - Algorithm that gradually increases the wait time between retries after failures. Starts with a short delay, then doubles the delay with each retry. Prevents overwhelming recovering systems with retry storms.

## Concurrency and Transactions

1. **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking**:
    - **Optimistic**: Assumes conflicts are rare and only verifies at commit time if data has changed since it was read. Offers better performance when conflicts are infrequent.
    - **Pessimistic**: Locks resources as they're accessed to prevent others from modifying them. Guarantees data integrity but reduces concurrency.
2. **Transaction Isolation Levels**:
    - **Read Uncommitted**: Allows dirty reads (seeing uncommitted changes from other transactions).
    - **Read Committed**: Only sees committed data but may see different data on multiple reads within a transaction.
    - **Repeatable Read**: Guarantees same data will be read for multiple reads within a transaction.
    - **Serializable**: Highest isolation; transactions behave as if executed serially.
3. **Distributed Transactions** - Transactions that span multiple services or databases. Requires coordination protocols like Two-Phase Commit to ensure all participants either commit or roll back together, maintaining consistency across distributed systems.
4. **Idempotency** - Property where an operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. Critical for reliable systems, allowing safe retries without side effects. Example: Setting a value is idempotent, incrementing a counter is not.

These concepts form the foundation of modern distributed system design and provide solutions to common challenges in building scalable, reliable, and performant applications.

    - **Long Polling**: Client requests information from server; if no data is available, server holds connection open until data arrives or timeout occurs.
    - **WebSockets**: Provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, allowing real-time data exchange in both directions.
    - **Server-Sent Events**: Enables servers to push updates to browsers as one-way communication channel, ideal for real-time updates.
2. **Publisher-Subscriber Model** - Communication pattern where senders (publishers) don't send messages directly to receivers (subscribers). Instead, messages are categorized and subscribers receive only categories they're interested in, without knowledge of publishers.
3. **Push vs. Pull Models**:
    - **Push (fanout-on-write)**: Updates are immediately pushed to all relevant users/clients when data changes. Fast but can overwhelm systems with many recipients.
    - **Pull (fanout-on-load)**: Clients request updates periodically or on-demand. More scalable but may introduce latency.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

1. **Bloom Filters** - Space-efficient probabilistic data structure that tells you if an element is definitely not in a set or might be in a set. Used for quick membership checks before expensive operations, reducing unnecessary database lookups.
2. **QuadTrees** - Tree data structure where each node has exactly four children, used to partition two-dimensional space recursively. Efficient for spatial data like maps, allowing fast queries like "find all points within this area."
3. **Rate Limiting Algorithms**:
    - **Leaky Bucket**: Requests enter a fixed-size bucket; when the bucket is full, new requests are discarded. Requests leave at a constant rate.
    - **Token Bucket**: System adds tokens to a bucket at a steady rate; each request requires a token. When tokens are depleted, requests are denied until more tokens are added.
4. **Trie Data Structure** - Tree-like data structure optimized for prefix searches. Each node represents a character, and paths from root to nodes form words or prefixes. Efficient for implementing features like autocomplete, spell-check, or IP routing.

## Specialized System Designs

1. **Distributed File Systems** - Systems that manage storage and allow access to files from multiple hosts sharing a network. Files are split across multiple machines for scaling, while appearing as a single coherent file system. Examples include HDFS, GlusterFS.
2. **Distributed Search** - Search systems where both the index and query processing are spread across multiple machines. Enables searching massive datasets by partitioning the index and parallelizing the search process. Examples include Elasticsearch, Solr.
3. **Feed Generation Systems** - Systems that aggregate, rank, and deliver personalized content streams to users. Involves collecting inputs from many sources, filtering based on relevance, and generating personalized feeds efficiently. Used in social networks, news apps.
4. **Geospatial Indexing** - Specialized indexing techniques for location data that enable efficient queries like "find all restaurants within 5 miles." Uses structures like R-trees, quad trees, or geohashes to optimize spatial queries.

## Operational Concepts

1. **Health Checks** - Periodic tests performed on system components to determine if they're functioning correctly. Critical for load balancers to route traffic only to healthy servers and for early problem detection.
2. **Rate Limiting** - Controlling how many requests a user or service can make within a time period. Protects systems from abuse, denial-of-service attacks, and excessive resource consumption by limiting request frequency.
3. **Checkpointing** - Process of saving a system's state to persistent storage at consistent intervals. Allows recovery from a known good state after a failure without starting from scratch. Common in long-running processes.
4. **Exponential Backoff** - Algorithm that gradually increases the wait time between retries after failures. Starts with a short delay, then doubles the delay with each retry. Prevents overwhelming recovering systems with retry storms.

## Concurrency and Transactions

1. **Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Locking**:
    - **Optimistic**: Assumes conflicts are rare and only verifies at commit time if data has changed since it was read. Offers better performance when conflicts are infrequent.
    - **Pessimistic**: Locks resources as they're accessed to prevent others from modifying them. Guarantees data integrity but reduces concurrency.
2. **Transaction Isolation Levels**:
    - **Read Uncommitted**: Allows dirty reads (seeing uncommitted changes from other transactions).
    - **Read Committed**: Only sees committed data but may see different data on multiple reads within a transaction.
    - **Repeatable Read**: Guarantees same data will be read for multiple reads within a transaction.
    - **Serializable**: Highest isolation; transactions behave as if executed serially.
3. **Distributed Transactions** - Transactions that span multiple services or databases. Requires coordination protocols like Two-Phase Commit to ensure all participants either commit or roll back together, maintaining consistency across distributed systems.
4. **Idempotency** - Property where an operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. Critical for reliable systems, allowing safe retries without side effects. Example: Setting a value is idempotent, incrementing a counter is not.

These concepts form the foundation of modern distributed system design and provide solutions to common challenges in building scalable, reliable, and performant applications.

# Trade-off Decision Trees for System Design

This document provides decision frameworks for key trade-offs in system design, helping guide architects to appropriate choices based on specific requirements.

## 1. Consistency vs. Availability Trade-offs

### Decision Tree

```
Is your system mission-critical where data correctness is paramount? (financial systems, medical)
├── Yes: Prioritize Strong Consistency
│   ├── Can you tolerate higher latency?
│   │   ├── Yes: Use traditional RDBMS with ACID properties
│   │   └── No: Consider NewSQL databases (e.g., Google Spanner, CockroachDB)
│   └── Are you operating in a single region?
│       ├── Yes: Traditional master-slave replication may suffice
│       └── No: Need a distributed consensus protocol (Paxos/Raft)
└── No: Availability can take priority
    ├── Is eventual consistency acceptable?
    │   ├── Yes: Use BASE systems (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB)
    │   └── No: Consider hybrid approaches with tunable consistency
    └── Are read operations more frequent than writes?
        ├── Yes: Consider CQRS pattern with eventual consistency
        └── No: Evaluate if strong consistency is actually needed

```

### Key Considerations

- **High Consistency Cost**:
    - Increased latency due to synchronization
    - Reduced availability during network partitions
    - Often requires distributed locking mechanisms
- **High Availability Benefit**:
    - Better user experience with less downtime
    - Simpler scaling across regions
    - More resilient to network partitions
- **When to Choose Consistency**:
    - Financial transactions
    - Medical systems
    - Any system where incorrect data could cause harm or significant issues
- **When to Choose Availability**:
    - Social media applications
    - Content delivery systems
    - Systems where temporary inconsistency has minimal impact

## 2. Performance vs. Scalability Trade-offs

### Decision Tree

```
What is your primary concern for the system?

## 3. Storage vs. Computation Trade-offs

### Decision Tree

```
What is your application's dominant workload?
├── Data-Intensive (Storage)
│   ├── Is data primarily static or rapidly changing?
│   │   ├── Static: Invest in efficient storage and indexing
│   │   └── Changing: Need balanced approach with good update performance
│   └── Is data access pattern predictable?
│       ├── Yes: Optimize storage structure for specific access patterns
│       └── No: Use more general storage structures with flexible access methods
└── Compute-Intensive
    ├── Are calculations repeatable with the same inputs?
    │   ├── Yes: Consider caching computed results
    │   └── No: Focus on computational efficiency
    └── Are calculations parallelizable?
        ├── Yes: Distribute computation across multiple nodes
        └── No: Optimize single-thread performance and consider pre-computation

```

### Key Considerations

- **Storage-Heavy Approach**:
    - Precomputes and stores results for faster retrieval
    - Increases storage costs but reduces computation time
    - Introduces challenges for data freshness and updates
- **Computation-Heavy Approach**:
    - Calculates results on-demand
    - Reduces storage needs but increases computation costs
    - Ensures results are always based on the latest data
- **When to Store More**:
    - Expensive calculations that are frequently repeated
    - When query response time is critical
    - When data changes infrequently
- **When to Compute More**:
    - When storage costs are prohibitive
    - When data changes frequently
    - When personalization requires unique calculations per request

## 4. Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Processing

### Decision Tree

```
Does the operation need to complete before responding to the user?
├── Yes: Synchronous Processing
│   ├── Is the operation time-consuming?
│   │   ├── Yes: Consider optimizing the critical path only
│   │   └── No: Synchronous processing is appropriate
│   └── Will users wait for completion?
│       ├── Yes: Provide progress indicators for long operations
│       └── No: Reconsider if this truly needs to be synchronous
└── No: Asynchronous Processing
    ├── Does the user need confirmation the task was accepted?
    │   ├── Yes: Use immediate acknowledgment with background processing
    │   └── No: Pure asynchronous processing is suitable
    └── Does the operation affect user-visible state?
        ├── Yes: Implement notification mechanism when complete
        └── No: Simple fire-and-forget may be sufficient

```

### Key Considerations

- **Synchronous Processing**:
    - Provides immediate consistency and feedback

    - Ties up system resources during processing
    - Can create cascading failures under high load
- **Asynchronous Processing**:
    - Improves system responsiveness and throughput
    - Complicates error handling and state management
    - Requires additional infrastructure (queues, workers)
    - May introduce eventual consistency challenges
- **When to Use Synchronous**:
    - Critical user operations requiring immediate confirmation
    - Simple, fast operations where overhead of async is unnecessary
    - When exact order of operations matters
    - Authentication and authorization flows
- **When to Use Asynchronous**:
    - Resource-intensive operations (image/video processing)
    - Non-critical background tasks (analytics, cleanup)
    - Batch processing operations
    - Operations that can fail without immediate user impact

## 5. Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture

## 7. Caching Strategy Decisions

### Decision Tree

```
Where should cache be positioned?
├── Client-side caching
│   ├── Is content user-specific?
│   │   ├── Yes: Browser storage with clear privacy controls
│   │   └── No: Consider shared CDN caching
│   └── Is offline access important?
│       ├── Yes: Implement service workers and local storage
│       └── No: Standard HTTP caching may suffice
└── Server-side caching
    ├── What's being cached?
    │   ├── Database results: Consider cache-aside pattern
    │   ├── API responses: Response caching layer
    │   ├── Computed values: Computation result cache
    │   └── Sessions: Distributed session store
    └── What's your invalidation strategy?
        ├── Time-based: Set appropriate TTL based on freshness needs
        ├── Change-based: Implement cache invalidation on updates
        └── Version-based: Cache keys include content version

```

### Key Considerations

- **Cache Location Trade-offs**:
    - Client-side: Reduces network trips but harder to control
    - Edge (CDN): Excellent for static content, geographically distributed
    - Application layer: Flexible but adds application complexity
    - Database layer: Reduces database load but may miss application-level optimizations
- **Cache Policy Decisions**:
    - Time-To-Live (TTL): Simple but may serve stale data or refresh too often
    - Write-through: Consistent but adds write latency
    - Write-behind: Better performance but risk of data loss
    - Cache-aside: Control over cache population but potential for thundering herd
- **When to Use Aggressive Caching**:
    - Static content with infrequent changes
    - Read-heavy workloads
    - Expensive computations with reusable results
    - When reducing backend load is critical
- **When to Limit Caching**:
    - Highly personalized content
    - Security-sensitive information
    - Frequently changing data
    - When data consistency is more important than performance

## 8. Message Queue Implementation Decisions

### Decision Tree

```
What are your messaging requirements?
├── Simple task distribution
│   ├── Is ordering important?
│   │   ├── Yes: Single-partition queue with guaranteed ordering
│   │   └── No: Multi-partition queue for better throughput
│   └── Are tasks time-sensitive?
│       ├── Yes: Low-latency queues with priority support
│       └── No: Batch processing may be more efficient
└── Complex message routing
    ├── What delivery guarantee do you need?
    │   ├── At-least-once: Simple acknowledgment-based systems
    │   ├── Exactly-once: Transactional or idempotent processing
    │   └── At-most-once: Fire-and-forget delivery
    └── Do you need pub/sub capabilities?
        ├── Yes: Topic-based messaging system (Kafka, SNS)
        └── No: Simple queue may suffice (SQS, RabbitMQ)

```

### Key Considerations

- **Queue Implementation Options**:
    - In-memory: Fastest but no persistence across restarts
    - Disk-backed: Durable but higher latency
    - Distributed: Scalable and fault-tolerant but complex
    - Managed service: Low operational overhead but potential vendor lock-in
- **Delivery Guarantees**:
    - At-least-once: Ensures messages aren't lost but may deliver duplicates
    - Exactly-once: Most difficult to implement but prevents duplicates
    - At-most-once: Simplest but may lose messages
- **When to Use Simple Queues**:
    - Task distribution to workers
    - Batch processing jobs
    - Rate limiting and buffering
    - When basic FIFO behavior is sufficient
- **When to Use Advanced Messaging Systems**:
    - Event-driven architectures
    - Complex routing requirements
    - High-throughput data streaming
    - When pub/sub patterns are needed

## 9. Replication Strategy Decisions

### Decision Tree

```
What is your primary concern for replication?
├── High Availability
│   ├── Can you tolerate any data loss?
│   │   ├── Yes: Asynchronous replication for better performance
│   │   └── No: Synchronous replication despite performance impact
│   └── How many simultaneous failures must you withstand?
│       ├── Single node: Simple primary-replica setup
│       └── Multiple nodes: Multi-region replication with quorum writes
└── Read Scaling
    ├── Is your workload read-heavy?
    │   ├── Yes: Many read replicas with async replication
    │   └── No: Focus on write performance instead
    └── Can reads be eventually consistent?
        ├── Yes: Asynchronous read replicas
        └── No: Either synchronous replicas or primary-only reads

```

### Key Considerations

- **Replication Models**:
    - Single-leader: Simplest but has a single point of failure for writes
    - Multi-leader: Allows writes to multiple nodes but introduces conflict resolution
    - Leaderless: Highly available but requires quorum reads/writes
- **Consistency vs. Latency**:
    - Synchronous: Stronger consistency but higher latency
    - Asynchronous: Lower latency but potential for data loss
    - Semi-synchronous: Compromise between the two
- **When to Use Synchronous Replication**:
    - Financial systems requiring strict consistency
    - When data loss is unacceptable
    - Single-region deployments with low latency between nodes
    - Critical business operations
- **When to Use Asynchronous Replication**:
    - Global deployments where network latency is high
    - Read scaling across regions
    - When availability is more important than consistency
    - Performance-sensitive applications

## 10. Partitioning Strategy Decisions

### Decision Tree

```
What is your primary reason for partitioning?
├── Data Volume Exceeds Single Node
│   ├── Is data access pattern uniform?
│   │   ├── Yes: Hash-based partitioning for even distribution
│   │   └── No: Consider workload-aware partitioning
│   └── Do you need efficient range queries?
│       ├── Yes: Range-based partitioning
│       └── No: Hash-based may provide better distribution
└── Performance Optimization
    ├── Are there clear data locality patterns?
    │   ├── Yes: Geographically distributed partitioning
    │   └── No: Focus on workload distribution
    └── Is write throughput the bottleneck?
        ├── Yes: Partition to distribute write load
        └── No: Optimize for read access patterns

```

### Key Considerations

- **Partitioning Schemes**:
    - Hash-based: Even distribution but poor range query performance
    - Range-based: Excellent for range queries but potential for hot spots
    - Directory-based: Flexible but adds lookup overhead
    - Composite: Combines approaches for different advantages
- **Rebalancing Concerns**:
    - Fixed partitioning: Simple but inflexible as data grows
    - Dynamic partitioning: Adapts to data growth but more complex
    - Consistent hashing: Minimizes data movement when adding nodes
- **When to Use Hash Partitioning**:
    - When data distribution needs to be even
    - When range queries are infrequent
    - When adding/removing nodes is common
    - For simpler implementation
- **When to Use Range Partitioning**:
    - When range queries are frequent
    - For time-series data with temporal access patterns
    - When data has natural ordering that aligns with access patterns
    - When you can predict and manage potential hot spots

# Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation Templates

This document provides frameworks, formulas, and examples for quickly estimating system requirements in system design interviews.

## General Principles

1. **Start with base facts and assumptions**
    - Use round numbers to simplify calculations
    - Document your assumptions clearly
    - Use commonly known statistics as anchors
2. **Use powers of 10 for easy calculation**
    - Approximate to nearest order of magnitude
    - Use 10^3 (1,000), 10^6 (1 million), 10^9 (1 billion)
3. **Apply reasonable constraints**
    - 86,400 seconds per day (round to 90k for calculations)
    - 2.5 million seconds in a month (86,400 × 30)
    - 30 days in a month for rough calculations
4. **Sanity check your results**
    - Verify order of magnitude looks reasonable
    - Compare against real-world systems you're familiar with

## Useful Conversion References

### Time Conversions

- 1 second = 1,000 milliseconds (ms)
- 1 millisecond = 1,000 microseconds (μs)
- 1 microsecond = 1,000 nanoseconds (ns)
- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour
- 24 hours = 1 day
- ~30 days = 1 month
- 365 days = 1 year

### Data Size Conversions

- 8 bits = 1 byte
- 1 Kilobyte (KB) = 1,000 bytes (10^3)
- 1 Megabyte (MB) = 1,000 KB (10^6 bytes)
- 1 Gigabyte (GB) = 1,000 MB (10^9 bytes)
- 1 Terabyte (TB) = 1,000 GB (10^12 bytes)
- 1 Petabyte (PB) = 1,000 TB (10^15 bytes)

*Note: Sometimes 1 KB is calculated as 1,024 bytes (2^10), but powers of 10 are easier for rough calculations*

## Traffic Estimation Templates

### QPS (Queries Per Second) Calculation

```
Daily Active Users (DAU) × Actions per user per day / Seconds per day = QPS

Example:
- 1 million DAU
- Each user performs 20 actions/day
- 86,400 seconds per day (round to 90,000 for simplicity)

QPS = 1,000,000 × 20 / 90,000 = 222 queries/second

```

### Peak QPS Estimation

```
Average QPS × Peak ratio = Peak QPS

Example:
- Average QPS: 222
- Peak traffic is typically 3x average

Peak QPS = 222 × 3 = 666 queries/second

```

### Read vs. Write Ratio Calculation

```
For a ratio of N:1 (read:write):
- Read QPS = Total QPS × N/(N+1)
- Write QPS = Total QPS × 1/(N+1)

Example:
- Total QPS: 222
- Read:Write ratio = 5:1

Read QPS = 222 × 5/6 = 185 reads/second
Write QPS = 222 × 1/6 = 37 writes/second

```

## Storage Estimation Templates

### Database Storage Calculation

```
Number of records × Size per record × Retention period = Storage needed

Example:
- 1 million new records per day
- 1 KB per record
- 5 year retention

Daily storage: 1,000,000 × 1 KB = 1 GB/day
Total storage: 1 GB × 365 × 5 = 1,825 GB ≈ 1.8 TB

```

### Text Storage Calculation

```
For text storage:
- ASCII: 1 byte per character
- UTF-8: 1-4 bytes per character (avg ~1.5 for English, ~3 for CJK)

Example:
- 100 million tweets per day
- Average 280 characters per tweet
- Average 2 bytes per character (UTF-8 with emojis)

Daily storage: 100,000,000 × 280 × 2 bytes = 56 GB/day
Monthly storage: 56 GB × 30 = 1,680 GB ≈ 1.7 TB

```

### Media Storage Calculation

```
Media files per day × Average file size = Daily storage needed

Example:
- 10 million photos uploaded per day
- Average photo size: 200 KB

Daily storage: 10,000,000 × 200 KB = 2,000,000,000 KB = 2 TB/day
Annual storage: 2 TB × 365 = 730 TB

```

### Metadata Storage Calculation

```
Number of items × Metadata size per item = Metadata storage

Example:
- 1 billion user profiles
- 1 KB metadata per user (username, email, settings, etc.)

Total storage: 1,000,000,000 × 1 KB = 1 TB

```

## Bandwidth Estimation Templates

### Inbound Bandwidth Calculation

```
Write QPS × Average request size = Inbound bandwidth

Example:
- 1,000 writes per second
- Average request size: 10 KB

Inbound bandwidth = 1,000 × 10 KB = 10,000 KB/s = 10 MB/s

```

### Outbound Bandwidth Calculation

```
Read QPS × Average response size = Outbound bandwidth

Example:
- 5,000 reads per second
- Average response size: 100 KB

Outbound bandwidth = 5,000 × 100 KB = 500,000 KB/s = 500 MB/s

```

### CDN Traffic Calculation

```
Read QPS × Average asset size × (1 - Cache hit ratio) = Origin server bandwidth

Example:
- 10,000 image requests per second
- Average image size: 200 KB
- CDN cache hit ratio: 95%

Origin bandwidth = 10,000 × 200 KB × 0.05 = 100,000 KB/s = 100 MB/s

```

## Memory Estimation Templates

### Cache Size Calculation

```
QPS × Time window to cache × Average response size × (1 + Overhead factor) = Cache size

Example:
- 1,000 read QPS
- Cache responses for 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Average response size: 10 KB
- Overhead factor: 0.2 (20% overhead for cache keys, metadata)

Cache size = 1,000 × 300 × 10 KB × 1.2 = 3,600,000 KB ≈ 3.6 GB

```

### Working Set Calculation

```
Active items ratio × Total items × Average item size = Working set size

Example:
- 20% of items are "hot" (frequently accessed)
- 100 million total items
- 1 KB per item

Working set size = 0.2 × 100,000,000 × 1 KB = 20,000,000 KB = 20 GB

```

### Connection Memory Overhead

```
Max connections × Memory per connection = Connection memory overhead

Example:
- 10,000 concurrent connections
- 10 KB memory overhead per connection

Connection memory = 10,000 × 10 KB = 100,000 KB = 100 MB

```

## CPU Estimation Templates

### Request CPU Cost Calculation

```
QPS × CPU time per request = CPU cores needed

Example:
- 1,000 QPS
- Each request takes 10ms of CPU time

CPU usage = 1,000 × 0.01s = 10 CPU-seconds per second = 10 cores at 100% utilization
For 50% target utilization: 10 / 0.5 = 20 cores needed

```

### Database CPU Calculation

```
(Read QPS × CPU cost per read) + (Write QPS × CPU cost per write) = CPU cores needed

Example:
- 900 read QPS, 100 write QPS
- Each read takes 5ms of CPU time
- Each write takes 10ms of CPU time

CPU usage = (900 × 0.005) + (100 × 0.01) = 4.5 + 1 = 5.5 CPU-seconds per second
For 60% target utilization: 5.5 / 0.6 ≈ 9.2 → 10 cores needed

```

## System-Specific Estimation Templates

### URL Shortener Estimation

```
Daily URLs to shorten: 1 million
Storage per URL:
- Original URL: ~100 bytes avg
- Shortened URL: 6-8 bytes
- Metadata: ~50 bytes
Total per entry: ~160 bytes

Daily storage: 1,000,000 × 160 bytes = 160 MB/day
Annual storage: 160 MB × 365 = 58.4 GB

```

### Social Media Feed Estimation

```
Active users: 10 million DAU
Average friends/connections: 300
Feed refresh rate: 5 times per day per user
Posts per user per day: 2

Feed generation queries: 10,000,000 × 5 / 86,400 ≈ 580 QPS
Post ingestion rate: 10,000,000 × 2 / 86,400 ≈ 230 QPS

For each feed generation:
- Recent posts from ~300 connections
- Each post ~1 KB
- Total feed size: ~300 KB

```

### Video Streaming Estimation

```
Concurrent viewers: 100,000
Video bitrates:
- Low: 1 Mbps
- Medium: 3 Mbps
- High: 6 Mbps

Assuming distribution:
- 20% low: 20,000 × 1 Mbps = 20 Gbps
- 50% medium: 50,000 × 3 Mbps = 150 Gbps
- 30% high: 30,000 × 6 Mbps = 180 Gbps

Total outbound bandwidth: 350 Gbps

```

### E-commerce Product Catalog Estimation

```
Product count: 10 million
Size per product:
- Basic info: 1 KB
- 5 images × 200 KB = 1,000 KB
- Reviews and metadata: 10 KB
Total per product: ~1,011 KB

Catalog storage: 10,000,000 × 1,011 KB ≈ 10.11 TB

Daily product views: 50 million
Product view QPS: 50,000,000 / 86,400 ≈ 580 QPS

```

## Practical Example: Twitter-like Service

Let's estimate the requirements for a Twitter-like service:

### Given Facts

- 200 million daily active users (DAU)
- Each user posts 5 tweets per day on average
- Each user views their timeline 20 times per day
- Read:write ratio is 100:1
- Average tweet is 200 characters

### Storage Calculation

Each tweet record:

- Tweet ID: 8 bytes
- User ID: 4 bytes
- Tweet content: 200 characters × 2 bytes = 400 bytes
- Metadata (timestamp, location, etc.): 30 bytes
- Indexes and overhead: ~30% = 132 bytes
Total per tweet: ~574 bytes

Daily new tweets: 200,000,000 × 5 = 1 billion tweets
Daily storage required: 1,000,000,000 × 574 bytes ≈ 574 GB/day
5-year storage: 574 GB × 365 × 5 ≈ 1,047,550 GB ≈ 1 PB

### Traffic Calculation

Tweet creation QPS: 200,000,000 × 5 / 86,400 ≈ 11,574 QPS
Timeline view QPS: 200,000,000 × 20 / 86,400 ≈ 46,296 QPS
Total QPS: 11,574 + 46,296 = 57,870 QPS

Assuming peak is 3× average: Peak QPS ≈ 173,610 QPS

### Bandwidth Calculation

Average timeline response (100 tweets with metadata): ~100 KB
Outbound bandwidth: 46,296 QPS × 100 KB = 4,629,600 KB/s ≈ 4.6 GB/s
Inbound bandwidth: 11,574 QPS × 1 KB = 11,574 KB/s ≈ 11.6 MB/s

### Server Estimation

Assuming each web server can handle 1,000 QPS:
Number of web servers needed: 57,870 / 1,000 ≈ 58 servers
For peak: 173,610 / 1,000 ≈ 174 servers

### Memory Calculation

Hot data (active timelines):

- 20% of users are highly active: 40 million users
- Each user's recent timeline: ~200 KB
Cache size needed: 40,000,000 × 200 KB = 8,000,000,000 KB = 8 TB

## Guidelines For Effective Estimations

1. **Round numbers liberally** - Use powers of 10 for easy mental math
2. **Document assumptions clearly** - They're often more important than the calculation itself
3. **Provide ranges when uncertain** - "Between 10-100 GB" is better than a precise but wrong number
4. **Start with what you know** - Build from real-world data points when possible
5. **Work incrementally** - Break complex estimates into simpler subproblems
6. **Consider growth factors** - Account for user growth, data accumulation over time
7. **Be prepared to adjust** - If interviewer provides new information, quickly recalculate
8. **Consider hot spots** - Averages can hide critical performance issues
9. **Estimate conservatively** - Better to overprovision than underprovision
10. **Think about pricing implications** - Understanding rough costs shows business awareness

Remember that back-of-the-envelope calculations are meant to be rough estimates that help guide architectural decisions, not precise predictions. The goal is to be "roughly right" rather than "precisely wrong."

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Skipping Requirements Clarification

**Pitfall:** Jumping straight into design without clarifying requirements.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Always start by asking clarifying questions and restating requirements to ensure alignment.

### 2. Unrealistic Estimations

**Pitfall:** Making wild guesses or providing precise numbers without justification.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Make reasonable assumptions, show your calculation process, and sanity-check results.

### 3. Overdesigning

**Pitfall:** Creating an unnecessarily complex system with features beyond requirements.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Stay focused on the core requirements, explicitly mention what's out of scope.

### 4. Neglecting Trade-offs

**Pitfall:** Presenting design decisions without acknowledging their limitations.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Explicitly discuss trade-offs for major decisions, showing awareness of alternatives.

### 5. Poor Time Management

**Pitfall:** Spending too much time on initial parts, rushing through critical components.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Follow the timing guidelines, watch for interviewer cues to move on.

### 6. Avoiding Challenges

**Pitfall:** Glossing over difficult aspects of the design.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Proactively address the most challenging parts, showing how you tackle complex problems.

### 7. Too Abstract or Too Detailed

**Pitfall:** Staying at 30,000 feet or diving too deep into implementation details.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Start high-level, then progressively dive deeper into 2-3 critical components.

### 8. Not Engaging the Interviewer

**Pitfall:** Monologuing without seeking feedback or guidance.

**Avoidance Strategy:** Check in periodically, ask if your approach makes sense, be responsive to hints.
