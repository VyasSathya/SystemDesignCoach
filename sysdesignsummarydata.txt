Design Prompt from Examples: Start by gathering and refining example prompts. This forms 
the foundation for the AI's responses.

Human-Centric Responses: Modify the AI responses to be more human-like and context-aware, 
based on the refined prompts.

Context Setup for AI: Ensure the AI knows where each feature or tab is located. 
This helps the AI provide specific guidance.

Guided Introductions: Create scripts for the AI to guide users through problem introductions.

State Awareness for Coach: Develop a mechanism for the coach to understand the current state of the workbook. 
This will help the coach provide relevant feedback.

First-Time Experience Sequencing: Develop a sequential tutorial approach for new users. 
This task depends on the state awareness.

Solution Button Options: Explore alternatives to a "See Solution" button, 
balancing guidance with direct answers. This follows after setting up guided introductions and state awareness.

Flow Definition & AI Constraints: Define an intuitive flow for the AI and set constraints. 
This task depends on the guided introductions and state awareness.

Coach & Grader Interaction: Develop a communication mechanism between the coach and grader for 
live feedback and focus adjustments. This interaction relies on the state awareness and defined flow.

Website Deployment: Research and deploy a basic version of the website for testing and data collection. 
This task depends on having a functioning AI with basic features.

Multiple User Support: Implement a system to handle multiple users and save states. 
This follows after deploying the website.

Diagram State Management: Store state in React Flow with Mermaid data and positions. 
This task can be worked on in parallel with multiple user support.

Log Requests & Responses: Implement logging for all requests and raw responses. 
This can be done once the website is deployed and multiple users are supported.

This list should give you a clear progression of tasks.
