# System Overview: Biological System Analogies

## AI System (Nervous System)
The central processing unit that handles all AI interactions, message processing, and decision making. Like the nervous system, it processes inputs, makes decisions, and coordinates responses across all other systems.

## Workbook System (Circulatory System)
Manages the flow of user work and content throughout the application. Similar to how blood circulates through the body, this system ensures user progress, diagrams, and feedback flow smoothly between different components.

## Grading System (Endocrine System)
Controls the evaluation and feedback mechanisms, releasing targeted assessments and recommendations. Like hormones in the endocrine system, it provides signals that influence and regulate user progress and learning.

## Data Pipeline System (Digestive System)
Processes and transforms raw data into usable formats, extracting valuable information. Just as the digestive system breaks down food into nutrients, this system converts raw data into meaningful insights.

## Coaching System (Muscular System)
Drives active learning and user interaction, providing structured guidance and exercises. Like muscles enabling movement, it helps users actively engage with and navigate through learning materials.

## Interview System (Respiratory System)
Maintains continuous dialogue flow and exchange of information during interview sessions. Similar to how breathing provides constant gas exchange, this system ensures steady communication flow.

## Monitoring System (Integumentary System)
Forms the protective outer layer that monitors system health and performance. Like skin sensing external conditions, it tracks metrics and detects potential issues.

## Feedback System (Lymphatic System)
Collects and processes user feedback to maintain system health and improvement. Similar to how the lymphatic system removes waste and maintains immunity, this system helps maintain quality and adapt to user needs.

## Infrastructure Core (Skeletal System)
Provides the fundamental structure and support for all other systems. Like the skeleton supporting the body, it offers the basic framework and infrastructure for the entire application.

## Prompt System (Immune System)
Manages AI prompts and ensures appropriate responses across different contexts. Like the immune system identifying and responding to different threats, this system helps maintain consistent and contextually appropriate AI behavior.
