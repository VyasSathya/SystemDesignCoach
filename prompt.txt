Context: Working on a system design workbook application with AI coaching. The app has basic auto-save functionality implemented in workbookStorage.js (3s) and RequirementsPage.js (30s).

Current Implementation:
- Auto-saves workbook data every 3 seconds
- Auto-saves requirements every 30 seconds
- Uses debouncing for performance
- Includes save status notifications

Next Steps Needed:
1. Test and verify auto-save reliability:
   - Add error recovery
   - Implement conflict resolution
   - Add offline support

2. Enhance auto-save features:
   - Add version history
   - Implement diff tracking
   - Add manual save checkpoints

3. Improve user feedback:
   - Add visual save indicators
   - Implement unsaved changes warnings
   - Add recovery options

Key files to focus on:
- client/utils/workbookStorage.js
- client/pages/RequirementsPage.js
- client/components/Workbook.js

Please help implement these improvements while maintaining performance and reliability.
