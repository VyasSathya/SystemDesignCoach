Walk me through the basic flow of how a user would interact with the service, starting from inputting a long URL to receiving and using the shortened URL.\"\n\nThis question helps to kick off the discussion by asking the candidate to:\n1. Identify the key components and overall architecture of the system\n2. Explain the basic flow and user interaction with the service\n\nIt allows the candidate to demonstrate their ability to break down the problem, identify the necessary components, and explain the system's functionality from a user's perspective.
